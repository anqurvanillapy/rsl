# Russell

*Russell*, my Rust lab, just like
[the C++ one of mine](https://github.com/anqurvanillapy/cppl).

## Concerns

* Patterns and anti-patterns
* Features (not general)
* Optimization
* Memory safety

## There's a reason, actually

Aaron Turon's `future-rs` project and his introduction to Rust's philosophy
draw my attention, well, ***passion***, as my interest in the async wilderness.

> *The problem is that green threads were at odds with Rust’s ambitions to be a
> true C replacement, with no imposed runtime system or FFI costs: we were
> unable to find an implementation strategy that didn’t impose serious global
> costs. You can read more in the RFC that removed green threading.*
